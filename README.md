# Client Risk Factors and Their Impact on Medical Charges

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between various client risk factors and their medical charges. The aim is to assess individual health risks and identify high-risk patients to optimize insurance premiums. The analysis includes visualizations and statistical methods to uncover significant patterns and correlations.

## Features
- **Correlation Analysis:** Explore the relationships between different health risk factors and medical charges.
- **Box Plots:** Visualize the distribution of medical charges across different categories (e.g., smoking habits, sex, physical activity).
- **Regression Analysis:** Apply linear regression to predict medical charges based on risk factors.
